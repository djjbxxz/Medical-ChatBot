# Medical Chatbot

This project is to build a medical chatbot that can answer user's questions about medical conditions, symptoms, and treatments. The chatbot is based on Llama2, fine-tunned on medical data, and deployed with Python Django framework.

# Known issue

The model sometimes can not give you specific medical advice, this is a limit set by the base model during pre-training. I am working on resolving this issue.

# Try it yourself

Please send me a message to get the link to the chatbot.
